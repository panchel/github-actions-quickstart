# github-actions-quickstart

Text note feedback:
Step 1 and 2 needs to be worded and explained better. When you say 'create .github/workflows directory' you forget an extra slash at the end of workflows to indicate that it is a directory, not a file. Thus, when people go to copy and paste the path into github, it doesn't automatically register as a path. Instead, it creates a new file. Then, the following steps are unclear that the next files need to be INSIDE the folder you need to create. You should combine the first couple of steps to create the directory and the yaml file in one step. It removes any confusion.
